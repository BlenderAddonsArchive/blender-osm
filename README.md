# OpenStreetMap Importer for Blender

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/vvoovv/blender-osm/images/import_osm.png)

## Introduction

The addon imports a file in the OpenStreetMap format (.osm).

There are free and [paid](https://gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) (2.85$) versions of the addon. The only difference between them is a popup window that shows up after the import finished. A mouse click closes the popup window and brings you to the [webpage](https://gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) to buy the paid version for just 2.85$.

By [buying](https://gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) the paid version you support the addon development.

The following items can be imported by the addon:
* Buildings. Building height, number of floors are used to create the final scene. Composition into 3D parts for a building with the complex structure is also processed.
* Water objects (rivers and lakes). Imported as polygons
* Highways, paths and railways. Imported as polygons.
* Vegetation (forests, grass, scrubs). Imported as polygons.

Polygons with holes are supported!
